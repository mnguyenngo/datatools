    "# Estimating Minimum Sample Size\n",

    "## Sample Size for Unlimited Populations\n",
    "Let's start off with unlimited populations, since large datasets are ubiquitous today, and for most applications, your population will be over a million. The equation is also simpler and it provides a conservative estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ n = \\frac{z^2 \\times \\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{\\epsilon^2} $$\n",

    "* $n$: minimum sample size\n",
    "* $z$: z-score (see Table in Appendix below)\n",
    "* $\\hat{p}$: proportion of the population\n",
    "* $\\epsilon$: margin of error\n",
    "\n",
    "You will typically be asked for the minimum sample size for a test given a margin error of 5% and a confidence interval of 95%. You will need to determine the proportion of the population, $\\hat{p}$, to determine the sample size. The most conservative estimate for sample size is when $\\hat{p} = 0.5$, so this is an easy choice to start.\n"
